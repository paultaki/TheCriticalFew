        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Embrace the “80/20 rule” to focus on the critical few, not the trivial many:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Delegate to unlock your team’s potential—and your own time.</li>
            <li>Keep communication and directives simple, cutting out unnecessary filler.</li>
            <li>Trust your frontline employees; they have valuable insights senior leaders often miss.</li>
            <li>“Carrying the bag” (doing the frontline job) builds credibility with your team.</li>
            <li>Encourage collaboration by ensuring every voice is heard—especially the quiet ones.</li>
            <li>Celebrate strategic risk-taking and learn from failures.</li>
            <li>Protect your nights and weekends by honing in on what truly matters.</li>
            <li>Believe in yourself and your people; a cohesive, empowered team can break records.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Focus on the Critical Few, Not the Trivial Many</h3>

        <h3>1. Let Go of the Handlebars (Trust Your People)</h3>
        <p>Remember the first time you took your hands off your bike’s handlebars as a kid?...</p>
        
        <h3>2. Apply the 80/20 Rule Relentlessly</h3>
        <p>The “Pareto Principle” says 80% of results come from 20% of efforts...</p>
        
        <h3>3. Simplify Your Communication</h3>
        <p>Early in my career, a mentor named Holly dropped by my desk and asked, “What are all those words?”...</p>
        
        <h3>4. “Carry the Bag” to Build Credibility</h3>
        <p>One of my greatest mentors, Kelly, told me I needed frontline sales experience if I wanted to earn a leadership role...</p>
        
        <h3>5. Delegate or Die</h3>
        <p>I once nearly lost my job for missing quota three months in a row...</p>
        
        <h3>6. Empower the Quiet Ones</h3>
        <p>When I first became a Senior Director, I gathered my managers for important discussions...</p>
        
        <h3>7. Listen to the Front Lines</h3>
        <p>In each new territory I led, I didn’t just hold “town halls” from a fancy boardroom—I sat in the bullpen with my sales reps...</p>
        
        <h3>8. Build a Culture of Collaboration</h3>
        <p>Carrots and sticks—money and fear—only go so far...</p>
        
        <h3>9. Protect Your Nights and Weekends</h3>
        <p>Finally, this approach gave me something most leaders think is unattainable: my nights and weekends back...</p>
        
        <h3>Conclusion: Believe and Let Go</h3>
